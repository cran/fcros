Description: A fold change rank based method is presented to search for genes with 
             changing expression and to detect recurrent chromosomal copy number 
             aberrations. This method may be useful for high-throughput biological 
             data (micro-array, sequencing, ...).
             Probabilities are associated with genes or probes in the data set and 
             there is no problem of multiple tests when using this method. For
             array-based comparative genomic hybridization data, segmentation 
             results are obtained by merging the significant probes detected.
